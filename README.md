# Phrank-score-computation-and-post-analysis
This code is used to compute the Phrank similarity score between patients and between gene and patient as part of the framework to discover recurrent de novo mutations in sets of paitents with similar phenotype.
This code also contains some post-analyses of the phrank scores including calculating the p-value and grouping patients based on their Phrank score using a self-invented algorithm.
